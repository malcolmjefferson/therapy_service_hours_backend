# therapy_service_hours_backend

Go API (AWS Lambda), migrations, SQL queries and the **OpenAPI contract** (`api/openapi.yaml`, source of truth). Part of the **Therapy Service Hours Tracker** (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)).

## Start here

- **Specification and working agreements:** [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
- **Engineering standards** (rules block merges): [docs/standards/](docs/standards/README.md)
- **Decisions:** [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md)
- **Backlog:** [docs/jira/](docs/jira/README.md)

## First-time setup

1. Install [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) (secret scanning, SEC-61).
2. Turn on the repo's git hooks once per clone:

   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```

   The pre-commit hook scans staged changes for secrets and **blocks the commit** if gitleaks is missing.

## Contributing

- `main` is protected: changes go through a pull request with passing checks (ARC-49).
- Work on a branch named after the ticket, for example `feat/S0-03-backend-skeleton`.
- Fill in the PR template, including the standards checklists.
- Client data is **pseudonyms or initials only**, everywhere (CLAUDE.md §0.7).
